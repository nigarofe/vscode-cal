# **Export**

## **(Generic)**

## **(Ubiquitous)**
* The system shall ensure the file is valid.
* The system shall ensure the content has a "questions" key with a list of all questions.
* The system shall ensure each question has the correct structure, including "number", "discipline", "source", "description", "proposition", "step-by-step", "answer", "tags", and "spaced_repetition_variables".

## **(State driven)**

## **(Event driven)**
* When I run the "exportQuestionsJson" command, the system shall create a new JSON file in the "src/.json" directory.
* When the "exportQuestionsJson" command is run, the system shall name the file starting with a timestamp and ending with "_questions.json".
