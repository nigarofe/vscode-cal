### **Render Question**

## **(Generic)**

## **(Ubiquitous)**

## **(State driven)**

## **(Event driven)**
  * When I run the "previewQuestion" command, the system shall open a webview panel with the title "Preview Q<question_number>".
  * When a question is previewed, the system shall render the question's proposition, step-by-step, and answer as HTML.

## **(Optional feature)**

## **(Unwanted behaviour)**

## **(Complex)**
  * While a question's proposition contains a LaTeX expression, when the question is previewed, the system shall correctly render the LaTeX as a mathematical formula.
  * While a question's step-by-step section contains a local image `![alt text](images/diagram.png)`, when the question is previewed, the system shall display the image from the workspace.
