Your task is to refactor a set of requirements.md files to conform to a structural guideline file.

  1. Understand the Guideline:
  First, read the file C:\Users\Nicholas\vscode-cal\features\README.md. This file contains mandatory EARS headings (e.g., ## **(Generic)**,
  ## **(Event driven)**, etc.) that must be used to structure the requirements.

  2. Understand the Goal:
  The goal is to preserve all existing requirements while organizing them under the correct EARS headings. You must not simply copy the
  guideline file's content or delete the existing requirements.

  3. Execution Plan:
  For each requirements.md file in the C:\Users\Nicholas\vscode-cal\features\ directory, you must:
      a. Read the existing content of the requirements.md file.
      b. Analyze each individual requirement statement to determine which EARS pattern it matches based on its syntax.
           - "When..." corresponds to (Event driven).
           - "While... when..." corresponds to (Complex).
           - "If... then..." corresponds to (Unwanted behaviour).
           - "The system shall..." corresponds to (Ubiquitous).
           - etc.
      c. Re-write the file so that it begins with the full, ordered list of mandatory EARS headings extracted from the README.md.
      d. Place each existing requirement from the original file under its corresponding new heading.
      e. If no requirements match a specific heading for a given file, leave that heading blank.

### **Question Management**

## **(Generic)**

## **(Ubiquitous)**
* The system shall open a new markdown editor when the "openQuestionByNumber" command is run with an existing question number.

## **(State driven)**

## **(Event driven)**
* When a user runs the "openQuestionByNumber" command and enters "7", the system shall open a new markdown editor.
* When the editor for question 7 is opened, the system shall ensure the editor content starts with "# Question 7".
* When the editor for question 7 is opened, the system shall ensure the editor content contains the correct front matter, including "discipline", "description", "source", and "tags".
* When the editor for question 7 is opened, the system shall ensure the editor content contains the "## Proposition", "## Step-by-step", and "## Answer" sections.

## **(Optional feature)**

## **(Unwanted behaviour)**
* If the "openQuestionByNumber" command is run with a non-existent question number "999", then the system shall show an error message "Question number 999 not found.".
* If the "openQuestionByNumber" command is run with an invalid input like "abc", then the system shall show an error message "Please enter a valid number.".
* If the "saveQuestion" command is run after removing the "## Proposition" heading from the question's content, then the system shall show an error message "Cannot save, please fix the errors first.".
* If the "saveQuestion" command is run with invalid content, then the system shall not update the database.

## **(Complex)**
* While a user has question number 7 open in the editor, when the user modifies the "description" in the front matter and runs the "saveQuestion" command, the system shall update the database with the new description for question 7.
* While a user has question number 7 open in the editor, when the "saveQuestion" command is successfully run, the system shall display a success message "Question 7 updated successfully.".

# Mandatory EARS Headings for `requirements.md`

To ensure clarity and consistency, each `requirements.md` file must contain dedicated sections for the following EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) patterns. This explicitly defines which patterns are being used for the system's requirements.

## **(Generic)**
While `<optional pre-condition>`, when `<optional trigger>`, the `<system name>` shall `<system response>`

---
## **(Ubiquitous)**
The `<system name>` shall `<system response>`

---
## **(State driven)**
While `<precondition(s)>`, the `<system name>` shall `<system response>`

---
## **(Event driven)**
When `<trigger>`, the `<system name>` shall `<system response>`

---
## **(Optional feature)**
Where `<feature is included>`, the `<system name>` shall `<system response>`

### **Recommendation**

## **(Generic)**

## **(Ubiquitous)**
  * The system shall prioritize question recommendations based on their potential memory gain multiplier.

## **(State driven)**

## **(Event driven)**
  * When the "recommendQuestion" command is run, the system shall identify the question with the highest "potentialMemoryGainMultiplier".
  * When a question is recommended, the system shall open a new markdown editor with the content of the recommended question.
  * When an attempt is successfully registered, the system shall show a success message confirming the attempt was registered.
  * When the "showAllQuestions" command is run, the system shall open a webview panel with the title "All Questions".
  * When the "All Questions" panel is opened, the system shall display a table of questions sorted in descending order by their "Potential Memory Gain Multiplier".

## **(Optional feature)**

## **(Unwanted behaviour)**
  * If the "recommendQuestion" command is run and all questions have a "potentialMemoryGainMultiplier" less than 1.0 or a non-numeric status, then the system shall show an information message stating "No questions are due for review at the moment. Great job!".
  * If the "recommendQuestion" command is run and the questions table in the database is empty, then the system shall show an error message stating "No questions found in the database to recommend.".
  * If an attempt is registered with no active editor, then the system shall show an information message stating "No active editor.".
  * If an attempt is registered for a non-question file, then the system shall show an error message stating "Could not determine question number.".

## **(Complex)**
  * While question 12 has a "potentialMemoryGainMultiplier" of 2.5, which is the highest among all questions, when the "recommendQuestion" command is run, the system shall open question 12 in a new editor.
  * While I have question number 7 open in the editor, when I register an attempt as "with help" using the command palette, the system shall record an attempt for question 7 with code 0.
  * While I have question number 7 open in the editor, when I register an attempt as "without help" using the command palette, the system shall record an attempt for question 7 with code 1.
  * While the "All Questions" panel is open, when a user clicks on the table row for question number 7, the system shall execute the "openQuestionByNumber" command for question 7.

### **Render Question**

## **(Generic)**

## **(Ubiquitous)**

## **(State driven)**

## **(Event driven)**
  * When I run the "previewQuestion" command, the system shall open a webview panel with the title "Preview Q<question_number>".
  * When a question is previewed, the system shall render the question's proposition, step-by-step, and answer as HTML.

## **(Optional feature)**

## **(Unwanted behaviour)**

## **(Complex)**
  * While a question's proposition contains a LaTeX expression, when the question is previewed, the system shall correctly render the LaTeX as a mathematical formula.
  * While a question's step-by-step section contains a local image `![alt text](images/diagram.png)`, when the question is previewed, the system shall display the image from the workspace.

### **Validation and Diagnostics**

## **(Generic)**

## **(Ubiquitous)**

## **(State driven)**

## **(Event driven)**
  * When a user opens a question file, the system shall run diagnostics and display any errors found.
  * When a user saves a question file, the system shall run diagnostics and display any errors found.
  * When a user changes the content of a question file, the system shall run diagnostics and display any errors found.

## **(Optional feature)**

## **(Unwanted behaviour)**
  * If a question file has no errors, then the system shall not report any diagnostic errors.
  * If a non-question file is open, then the system shall not run any diagnostics on it.
  * If a diagnostic error is reported, then the system shall not report the same error multiple times for the same issue.

## **(Complex)**
  * While a question file is open and is missing a front matter field like "discipline" or "source", when the diagnostics are updated, the system shall report a diagnostic error with the message "Front matter is missing the '<field>' field.".
  * While a question file is open and the 'tags' field is a string instead of an array, when the diagnostics are updated, the system shall report a diagnostic error with the message "Front matter must have 'tags' as an array.".
  * While a question file is open and is missing a required heading like "## Proposition" or "## Answer", when the diagnostics are updated, the system shall report a diagnostic error with the message "Markdown body is missing the '<heading>' heading.".
