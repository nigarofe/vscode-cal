# Ideas

## List
- Filters
- Time slider (In a way that I can see the table as if I were 10 days on the past, 12 days, etc), so I can get a better grasp of my progress
- User preferences (autoSaveEnabled, displayOptions, etc)
- Log of questions attempted
- PMG-X probability distribution: what PMG-X I have a chance of k% of improving my LaMI?
- When my yesterday's attempt was with help, it's probably a good idea to try it again today
- Questions that I attempted yesterday and could only do with help are of the utmost priority
- There are some questions that are pre-requisite to others. Make something to let this be clear, so I don't try to do something before the pre-requisite also being done that day?
- Column of question in latex and LLM output. Repeatable adn beautiful
- Obsidian vault data scraper to use with LLM
- Create column in the .csv to implement MIG data selection ([[r0 Video Introduction of MIG]])
- Possibilidade de marcar quest√µes temporariamente
- Color for last attempted questions that I needed help, this is a behavior that I already implemented naturally, but it would facilitated if the software could help me with that

# Interface description

# Design choices
This application design choices prioritize development simplicity.
Spending time making this application more secure or performing goes against this project's goals at this moment.

# Compartimentalization
The idea is to create black boxes: I shouldn't need to understand what each file of the code base does. I should actively hide what I'm not going to interact with so it doesn't load on my own working memory.

    # Monotonic tasks
Research into cognitive psychology suggests that prolonged engagement in monotonic tasks, such as repetitive problem-solving, can lead to diminished returns in educational outcomes. To counteract this, a multi-faceted approach to learning is proposed. By integrating diverse activities, such as text synthesis and hypothetical scenario construction (e.g., 'What text would precede this question?'), we can stimulate different cognitive functions. This methodology, which mirrors the engagement strategies in open-world game design, is theorized to enhance student motivation and facilitate higher-order thinking, as outlined in Bloom's taxonomy.
